### Setup and Configuration ###
Follow these steps to set up your environment for the demo.

1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) for your platform and follow the [installation and setting up instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/setup).

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Open File Explorer and browse to the **source/Setup** folder.

1. Copy the **nodecamp-connectingfrontandback-snippets** folder and paste it into the Visual Studio Code Extensions folder to install the JavaScript snippets for this demo. Depending on your platform it is located:
 * **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
 * **Mac**: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions` 
 * **Linux**: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`

1. Open a **command prompt/terminal** according to your platform in the **source/Begin/Chatroom** folder.

1. Run **npm install** to install all the missing dependencies.

### Using the Code Snippets ###

Throughout the demo document, you will be instructed to insert code blocks. For your convenience, most of this code is provided as code snippets, which you can access from within Visual Studio Code to avoid having to add it manually.

> **Note:** This demo is accompanied by a starting solution located in the **Begin** folder that allows you to follow the demo. Inside the source code you will also find an **End** folder containing the code that results from completing the steps in the demo. You can use this folder as guidance if you need additional help as you work through this demo.

## Demo ##
This demo is composed of the following segments:

1. [Adding libraries to the Frontend](#segment1)
1. [Listening and handling messages](#segment2)

<a name="segment1" />
### Adding libraries to the Frontend ###

1. In the command prompt/terminal run **code .** to open the current directory with **Visual Studio Code**.

1.  In the **Explore** view, open the **layout.jade** file located in the **views** folder and add the following code below the `block content` line.

	> **Speaking Point:** This includes the jQuery library hosted on the Microsoft Ajax Content Delivery Network. This CDN hosts popular third party JavaScript libraries such as jQuery and enables you to easily add them to your Web applications. You can significantly improve the performance of your Ajax applications by using a CDN. The contents of the CDN are cached on servers located around the world. The CDN supports SSL (HTTPS) in case you need to serve a web page using the Secure Sockets Layer.
	
	(Code Snippet - _ConnectingFrontAndBack - AddJQueryLib_)
	
	````JavaScript
	script(type='text/javascript' src='http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-2.1.1.min.js')
	````

1. Now, add the following code to include bootstrap and socket.io client.

	> **Speaking Point:** Socket.io provides its own client, that's why you are targeting the file located in the socket.io folder.

	(Code Snippet - _ConnectingFrontAndBack - AddBootstrapAndSocketIOLibs_)

	````JavaScript
	script(type='text/javascript' src='/javascripts/bootstrap.min.js')
	script(type='text/javascript' src='/socket.io/socket.io.js')
	````
1. In the **Explore** view, locate the **public/javascripts** folder and create a new **index.js** file by clicking the **New File** icon.

	![Creating a new file](images/VSCode/creating-a-new-file.png?raw=true "Creating a new file")
	
	_Creating a new file_

1. In the **Explore** view, open the **index.jade** file located in the **views** folder and add the following code at the end to include the **index.js** file to the view.

	(Code Snippet - _ConnectingFrontAndBack - IncludeIndexFile_)

	````JavaScript
	block body_end
		script(type='text/javascript' src='/javascripts/index.js')
	````

<a name="segment2" />
### Listening and handling messages ###

1. Open the **index.js** file in the **public/javascripts** folder and add the following code.

	(Code Snippet - _ConnectingFrontAndBack - SocketIO_)

	````JavaScript
	var socket = io();
	````

1. 	Now, add a click handler for the **Send Message** button which will send the message to the server.
	
	> **Note:**  The node backend will not resend the message that the client wrote back to itself but that’s alright because we added the message right away in the click function handler.

	(Code Snippet - _ConnectingFrontAndBack - SendMessages_)

	````JavaScript
	$('#send-message-btn').click(function () {
		 var msg = $('#message-box').val();
		 socket.emit('chat', msg);
		 $('#messages').append($('<p>').text(msg));
		 $('#message-box').val('');
		 return false;
	});
	````

1. Add the following code to append the message received on the chat channel from other users to the  div element with **messages** id.

	(Code Snippet - _ConnectingFrontAndBack - AppendMessagesReceived_)
	
	````JavaScript
	socket.on('chat', function (msg) {
		 $('#messages').append($('<p>').text(msg));
	});
	````

1. Run the application using Visual Studio Code debugger. To do this, you will first need to setup your debugging launch configuration file (**launch.json**). Bring up the **Debug** view by clicking on the Debugging icon in the View Bar on the side of Visual Studio Code. Click on the Configure gear icon and select **Node.js** as your Debug Environment; this will generate a **launch.json**. Make sure that the **Launch** configuration is selected in the dropdown and press **F5** to start debugging. For more infomation, see the [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging) documentation.

1. Open two instances of your browser, navigate to **http://localhost:3000** and send a few messages from the two different clients.
